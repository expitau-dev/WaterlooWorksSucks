We bring together successful Waterloo Alumni, students, and a small amount of funding with a program that creates the opportunity for students to take what they have learned in their co-op jobs and build something themselves as their co-op job. \nWhat is Eigenspace? \nAs a community of Waterloo students and alumni, building & supporting world class companies we use a venture studio model + community + a fund to support founders on their journey. Our program helps establish a baseline of knowledge that gets you started building momentum. \nWhat is the program? \nThe program is eight workshops that are one hour long and delivered online and eight discussion sessions that are offered as hybrid sessions (online and in person) with office hours available that day. \nAt the end of the eight week program you will be included in a group chat that includes University of Waterloo Alumni that have built companies, some are also YC alumni, and a few are active investors. You will meet some of them during the eight week programming. They include Farhan Thawar (multiple startups, most recently acquired by Shopify), Hongwei Liu of MappedIn, David Villarreal of Parrot Software (YC Alumni), Shan Lian, Jay Shah (YC Alumni), Rami Ashamed of Push (sold to Whoop), and Andrew Cross of Goosechase. \nWhat are your criteria? \nThis part is simple, you are a Waterloo student and we, as Alumni, know you are awesome. The only other criteria is that you have the ability to work on something and make significant progress in a short amount of time. \nIs there future investment available? \nEigenspace intends to invest in your future rounds and is currently establishing a fund. We will actively help you raise your first round or help you apply to Y-Combinator or another accelerator. \nWe want to help you find your path to success. \nAm I an employee of Eigenspace? \nAs a Venture Founder you own your work.

  "summary": "We are currently building a quantum computer/simulator based on neutral atoms trapped in arrays of optical traps, aka \"Rydberg atom arrays\". To deterministically prepare configurations of atoms with a pre-defined two-dimensional spatial arrangement, we load a random configuration of atoms in an array of thousand of optical traps, image the atoms on a camera, identify the traps that are missing an atom, and displace the surplus atoms to their assigned location. Solving this reconfiguration problem requires exploiting (1) reconfiguration algorithms to determine which atoms to move to which locations in the most efficient way and (2) low-latency control systems to compute and execute the displacement trajectories within the lifetime of the atom configuration. \nWe are seek three students to help us design, build, benchmark, and optimize our low-latency control system. The low-latency control system exploits a multi-threaded programming of a CPU and GPU processors to execute the algorithms and interfaces multiple devices (camera, frame grabber card, arbitrary waveform generator) to interface with our experimental system, so a demonstrated experience and interest programming embedded systems in C/C++ will be valuable. \nThis project has been in development for more than a year now. Depend on our progress, the project description might be updated to expand the applicability of the system, e.g., to implement optimal control pulses or quantum error correction codes.",
  "responsibilities": "The students will be responsible for contributing to all aspects of the project to bring it to production level towards near-term deployment in our experimental system. The students will also be responsible for presenting their results during collaboration meetings with our international collaborators.

Our students are getting admission to competitive graduate school programs and publishing their results generated while working with us. Our best students have so far came in with a stellar academic record and very strong academic background in system design, applied mathematics, and programming (acquired through both self-directed projects and formal courses), often without prior knowledge in quantum mechanics. They were independent, inquisitive, proactive, and hardworking, continuously seeking opportunities to improve themselves and achieve excellence. They enjoyed delivering elegant solutions to difficult problems. \nDesirable skills are strong programming skills for technical applications (e.g., C/C++, Python, Cuda, multi-threading/multi-processing systems), analytical and critical thinking skills (formulating hypotheses, gathering and synthesizing data, drawing conclusions), team working (working in small teams), and communication skills (presenting results in simple and clear logical terms). \nPlease highlight your skills and how you have acquired them in your cover letter.",
