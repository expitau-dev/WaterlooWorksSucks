  "summary": "Job Title: Economist/Analyst\nThe Economic Analysis Directorate is seeking to fill a number of co-op positions in its five divisions. We offer a fast-paced work environment where key environmental policies are put to the test using economic and policy analysis, and innovative valuation techniques. We are also challenged by some of the most significant policy questions facing government and Canadian society today including those related to climate change, air pollution, and water quality.\nFor more information about Environment and Climate Change Canada, see our internet site: https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html.\nDescription of work undertaken by divisions within the Economic Analysis Directorate:\nAnalysis and Modelling Division\nThe Analysis and Modeling Division's key mandate is the annual publication of Canada's greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions projections. The division also supports reporting obligations domestically and internationally to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) such as Canada's Seventh National Communication on Climate Change and Fourth Biennial Report, as well as to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). In addition, the division supports policy and regulatory development by analyzing the energy and emissions impacts of various GHG and air pollutant mitigation measures using its Energy, Emissions and Economy Model for Canada (E3MC).\nCurrent Analysis and Economic Research Division\nThe Current Analysis and Economic Research Division undertakes major research projects with important environmental policy relevance, such as Canada's Mid-Century Strategy. It develops metrics such as the Social Cost of Carbon, and develops assessments of the upstream greenhouse gas emissions associated with major energy and infrastructure projects. The division leads the department's work on files like fossil fuel subsidy reform and sustainable finance, including climate-related financial risk disclosure and supporting the Sustainable Finance Action Council (SFAC). The division also analyzes the competitiveness impacts of proposed environmental policies, such as regulations and carbon pricing.\nIntegrated Climate Lens Centre of Expertise\nThe Centre of Expertise (CoE) is a newly created team working on the creation and ongoing refinement of an analytical tool, the Integrated Climate Lens (ICL). The ICL aims to enhance knowledge of the climate impacts of Government proposals, to support taking decisions that meet the Government's climate and adaptation objectives. The ICL also aims to ensure that climate, economic, and inclusivity considerations are presented consistently as well as being integrated and considered together throughout Government decision-making processes. The ICL is presently in its pilot phase, involving six federal departments and the central agencies, and is intended to be applied across government departments on Memoranda to Cabinet, Budget Proposals and Treasury Board Submissions. Over the longer term, the CoE will be developing additional tools and support (e.g., climate training, modelling support, community building) to advance climate objectives across government.\nModel Development and Quantitative Research Division\nThe Model Development and Quantitative Research Division's mandate is to provide model?based analytical support to key policies such as carbon pricing and its competitiveness impacts, comparability of greenhouse gas mitigation efforts across countries and long-term technology?based issues such as the implications of 1.5 and 2°C emission pathways and transition to a low carbon economy. The division also develops provincial and territorial macroeconomic projections that support the development of Canada's GHG and air pollutant projections. In undertaking its mandate, the division maintains and uses a suite of Canadian provincial and international Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) and Integrated Assessment Models (IAM) for policy design and analysis to support domestic and international policy agenda. The division also maintains a detailed macroeconomic model - The Informetrica Model. With evolving policy priorities and needs, this division's activities provide opportunities for innovation in economic modeling. The division plays an active role in policy development through collaborative research such as Stanford's Energy Modeling Forum (EMF), academic engagement, and publications in scientific journals.\nRegulatory Analysis and Valuation Division\nThe Regulatory Analysis and Valuation Division is ECCC's center of expertise for economic, cost-benefit, and regulatory impact analysis. The division's main functions include developing and deploying a wide range of quantitative methodologies to assess regulatory proposals under environmental legislation, liaise with Treasury Board Secretariat Analysts, and collaborate with internal and external policy partners to write Regulatory Impact Analysis Statements that accompany regulations published in the Canada Gazette. There are increasing expectations for excellence in regulatory analysis (as outlined in the Cabinet Directive on Regulation) and the division consistently rises to the challenge. Work in the division covers a wide range of historical and emerging environmental issues, including climate change mitigation, mining effluent and water quality, chemical substance and pollutant management, and species at risk protection. The division also utilizes creative approaches to valuing species and habitat conservation as well as improvements in air and water quality, and maintains up-to-date records in the Environmental Valuation and Reference Inventory. Recent examples of the division's work include cost-benefit analyses for the Clean Fuel Regulations, Single-Use Plastics Prohibition Regulations, and Critical Habitat of the Woodland Caribou Boreal Population Order.",

  "summary": "Call for Applications: CIGI's Digital Policy Hub Fellowships\nThe Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) is launching the Digital Policy Hub, a transdisciplinary space where fellows (at undergraduate, masters, PhD and post-doc levels), industry leaders and government practitioners will come together to share and develop their research on the rapid evolution and governance of transformative technologies across a variety of sectors, both in Canada and across the globe. Applications are now open!\nThe Hub will host a diverse group of emerging, innovative thinkers from the social and natural sciences, providing opportunities for them to further develop their own research, analytical and policy skills. Fellows will spend periods ranging from four to eight months at the state-of-the-art CIGI Campus and remotely, linking to CIGI's existing network of more than 100 CIGI fellows from around the world. Participants will join common seminars and other activities that bring together innovative perspectives on research, provide an interface between research and policy, and advance career development.\nResearch Focus Areas and Approaches\nTransformative technologies are rapidly reshaping our world. Many are widely known - although often not well understood - for example, new, hyper-connected social media platforms such as TikTok, mRNA vaccines, electric vehicles, blockchain, quantum computing and artificial intelligence large language models. In parallel, the digitization of almost everything has created a more interdependent, data-driven world. While broad technological change is nothing new, many current developments are moving at an accelerated pace, on a global scale and with little or no coherent governance framework nationally or internationally. There is, therefore, a pressing need for transdisciplinary understanding on governance issues across the range of technologies and digitization. The Hub's research focuses address this need, centering on digital ethics and rights frameworks that assist in identifying and mitigating the gaps between rapid technological disruption and diffusion, and the lack of governance frameworks at the national and international levels.\nCore research areas include:\nData, economy and society\nArtificial intelligence\nOuter space\nDigitization, security and democracy\nThe environment and natural resources\nThe Hub is founded on transdisciplinary approaches (i.e., research that cuts across disciplines and engages fellows with policy makers and industry professionals) that seek to increase understanding of the socio-economic and technological impacts of digitization, as a means to improve the quality and relevance of research. Such an approach also broadens the capacity of participants to conduct work across disciplines.\nEligibility\nCanadian, permanent resident and international undergraduate students based at a Canadian academic institution can apply.\nRecent graduates with a doctorate are encouraged to apply as post-doctoral fellows.\nStudents must have a research supervisor at their academic institution who is willing to supervise them on this project and administer the funds through the institution.\nApplication requirements\nApplications must consist of a CV outlining your qualifications; a research proposal describing your proposed research and how it relates to one or more of the Hub's focus areas (2-3 pages); in addition to two letters of support.\nOne letter of support must show intent to provide research supervision during the duration of your tenure at the Digital Policy Hub and administer the funds through the institution, in addition to their recommendation.\nApplications must be submitted through student's university co-op office.\nApplications are accepted on a rolling basis with the aim to have cohorts begin in September 2023.\nSupervision requirements\nThe academic supervisor must be at the same institution as the fellow.\nThe academic supervisor must be eligible to hold tri-council funding at their institution.\nCan be from any academic discipline.\nPlease reach out to digitalhub@cigionline.org if there are any questions, and we look forward to hearing from you!",
  "responsibilities": "Structure and Responsibilities\nThe fellowships at the Digital Policy Hub will generally run 4-8 months.\nAll fellows will meet (with the option to do so in-person or virtually) at a joint biweekly seminar that is 2 hours in length, where they will share and compare research (through presentations, etc.). The seminars will also feature a guest speaker, who will discuss their detailed research and field experience aligning with one or more of the Hub's core research areas.\nAll Hub participants are to prepare research papers for publication during their tenure, which will be made available on the Hub's forthcoming virtual space. All participants will prepare at least one research publication related to the Hub's identified themes during their fellowship, with the expectation to produce a new publication every 4 months for the duration of their participation in the Hub. That said, we would also be open to negotiating the structure of research requirements, if there is a strong case.",
  "skills": "Required Skills:\nResearch design\nData collection and analysis\nInformation literacy\nCritical thinking\nReport writing\nProblem-solving\nCommunication (presenting findings through Hub seminar discussions, research papers and presentations)\nTime management",
  "compensation": "Compensation and benefits for Digital Policy Hub fellowships is as follows:\nPayment for undergraduate fellows is $20.80 - $25.52/hr.\nOnsite amenities include a laptop to use for the duration of the fellowship, office space and parking. However, there is no requirement to conduct the fellowship onsite (biweekly seminars can be attended remotely).",

By identifying these stem cells, he has fundamentally shifted the understanding of the origins and nature of human tumours .\nAs a result of Dr. Dick's research, the scientific community now understands that within the population of cancer cells, there are cells that possess various degrees of tumour-seeding ability and a large number of cells that are incapable of seeding a new tumour . His work on leukemia has led to important concepts that are now being applied to solid tumours as well.\nDr. Dick's proposed research program intends to further explore the nature of cancer stem cells, including the unique genes that are enabled or disabled in cancer stem cells, the pathways that determine their biological properties, and the factors present on the surface of and inside these cells. The new therapies that will arise based on this more thorough understanding will likely be less harmful to normal tissues and attack the cancer root more effectively.\nThe work done by the applicant is a corner stone of the research done in this high profile Stem Cell Lab.\nLearn more about Dr. John Dick Lab at http://www.jdstemcellresearch.ca/ and University Health Network at http://www.uhn.ca \nCAREER DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING: \nTraining in a wide variety of laboratory techniques and knowledge of laboratory equipment.\nExposure to a highly motivating academic environment at the cutting edge of human stem cell research.\nTeamwork\nOrganization\nAnalyzing and understanding data\nThis co-op experience will enable the applicant to attain experience of how to work in a fast-paced environment.\nOTHER JOB DETAILS: \nFlexible hours, may require occasional work on weekends.\nTwo consecutive work term commitment required.\nEasily Accessible by Transit, right on the Subway line.",

CBOs, created by members of the community, know these problems well. Solar energy, non-electric water filters, improved biomass cookstoves, and fuel briquettes are all modern low-cost technologies that can solve rural energy problems. ENVenture accelerates rural cooperatives/CBOs in Uganda to start clean energy ventures. We want everyone in the rural villages to easily access a quality affordable clean energy product for their home without having to travel to the closest city. ENVenture employs a \"venture capital\" model in identifying and recruiting CBOs. Through our Seed Incubator, we invest small amounts very early in a large number of CBOs. Over a 1-year period of monitoring their energy sales and loan repayments, the best performers are selected for our Growth Accelerator, which includes offering larger debt, financial management support, and investment-readiness. This model allows ENVenture to build a pipeline of viable local last mile distributors for clean energy, with capacity building at the heart of all its programs.\nENVenture is seeking UW co-op students to serve as Business Development Fellows to join our established fellowship program. Fellows are business coaches for our rural CBO partners that help enable them to launch a sustainable enterprise selling clean energy technologies in their community. The UW fellows will join a larger cohort of fellows who will be deployed at CBOs across Western Uganda. Fellows will also have an opportunity to interface with ENVision Mobile, a for-profit spin-off of ENVenture that empowers Ugandan micro-enterprises and other organizations with a variety of market data solutions.",

  "summary": "Plastic is everywhere. It touches everything that we use and see nowadays. However, this creates a huge problem. There are 300 million tonnes of plastic waste produced every year. To make it worse, less than 10% of them are being recycled or composted. The remaining will either go into the landfill or ocean. With this growing concern, 170 nations have pledged to significantly reduce the use of plastic by 2030. Sustainable packaging, such as fully recyclable and biodegradable packaging, is the solution, but they suffer from poor barrier properties to block water and oxygen that keep products fresh.\nNfinite Nanotechnology is an advanced material company that makes smart nanocoatings for sustainable packaging. We are accelerating the world's goal to eliminate plastic waste. Our superior barrier coatings can make biodegradable packaging more robust and existing packaging more recyclable to extend the shelf life of products and reduce plastic waste significantly. We are working with different brand owners to accelerate their sustainable packaging offering. The packaging will be used on a wide range of products, such as potato chips, cereal, juice boxes, granola bars, candy, crackers, and more. One day, you will find products with sustainable packaging enabled by our coating during your grocery shopping.\nNumber 1-7 plastic triangle recycling SPI code debunk: Type 1 and 2 plastics may be recycled; others don't get recycled often because of low value and lack of facilities.\nMore shocking facts about plastic: 10 Shocking Facts About Plastic | National Geographic\nAbout Nfinite: https://www.nfinitenano.com/",

  "summary": "Intent\nThe intent of the internship is to give an architect the opportunity for professional growth while they contribute to a studio doing cutting-edge design work in cohousing and other community-enhanced design. You will be contributing to the completion of real projects and unlike the majority of jobs, this internship provides a much wider array of experiences designing cohousing and multi-family and writing projects, we have published 14 books in the last 32 years. In this internship, you would be an activist and an organizer, as well as, an architect. The internship is not \"limited\" like typical entry jobs are, nor is it like school. You'll do a little of everything, from design programs to design to construction drawings to construction administration and land use planning, all in the context of community-enhanced design as a basis to building a viable and sustainable society. We design cohousing communities, affordable housing, childcare centers, and town planning. Although in these COVID times, we are mostly doing housing and planning consulting, schematic designs, but also doing a lot of planning and housing books, and activist architecture projects. You will definitely work on a book these days. It's a great experience to venture into the world of activist architecture.\nWe take the internship and the growth of the individual intern very seriously. Interns learn specific design information and techniques and develop skills not readily accessible to someone fresh out of school, or typical architectural practices, such as participatory design and sustainable architecture in the production of inexpensive multi-family housing. An internship at The Cohousing Company is an opportunity to participate in an office with a distinct social agenda-promotion of community, creating more sustainable environments and contribution to the human experience. \"If it doesn't work socially why bother\", is our mantra. It turns out if you can make it work socially, then cooperation will allow other goals like sustainability to more readily fall into place. Within The Cohousing Company framework there is opportunity for interns to explore their individual interests and their role in the fields of architecture, planning, and environmental design. We have also been doing more urban design of late.\nDesign Philosophy\nIt is our aim always to honor natural resources and to facilitate environmental design of the highest standard possible. We strive to make the buildings and environments beautiful and to employ energy and resource-efficient building techniques at all times. We specify low or non-toxic materials. And just because we are designing state-of-the-art housing does not mean that it is okay if the roof leaks-construction and architecture are one. In the end, we attempt to practice the art to its highest level. Once we agree that a proposed project is congruent with our basic philosophy and values, it is then our intent to fulfill it to its highest potential. This is where the intern comes in-developing models, sketches, research, and other means by which we can see, and thereby solve the problems and challenges posed by each project always trying to take the design to the next level.",
  "responsibilities": "The Cohousing Company intern is engaged in whatever projects are currently on the boards. This usually includes cohousing projects (mostly schematic designs these days), an affordable nonprofit housing project (activism), a planning project, and a book project.\nWritten Projects: Usually, each intern performs a research project, such as a post-occupancy evaluation project or similar.",
  "skills": "We expect that you come to the internship with basic drafting and presentation skills. We are a Macintosh office and use Vectorworks, SketchUp, Photoshop and InDesign-it is important you know these programs prior to interning here, at least the basics. Vectorworks has a free one-month trial. If a foreign student, we also would like you to be familiar with the feet and inches system. In recent years, we have had extremely qualified interns who were able to grow extensively from their previous experiences, and go forth and implement high-quality, yet affordable, multi-family housing, and highly functional neighborhoods.",
  "compensation": "Interns are paid $15.50 USD per hour. We do not attempt to make money with intern labor. The intern wage demonstrates more than anything else, that this is a steep learning curve scenario. You will learn a lot that you are not currently familiar with.\nCosts associated with airfare, the J1 visa and housing are not covered by The Cohousing Company however, we can assist the successful candidate in finding housing here in California.",
