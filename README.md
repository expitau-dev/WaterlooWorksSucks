# Waterloo Works Sucks
...so I made it better. This application uses scraped data off of Waterloo Works (A job application site) to provide a more user-friendly experience that allows for real-time search, filtering, saving/exporting, and the ability to see job descriptions without navigating to another page (which you think would be a given, but apparently not).

### Static webpage
The [statically-hosted webpage](https://expitau-dev.github.io/WaterlooWorksNow/) is available on GitHub, and uses strictly client-side data and has no authentication. There is also a seperately maintained version that enables secure password protection and fetches data from an API, but this is only available locally because I don't want to pay for GCP or AWS. Hopefully this should be sufficient though.
